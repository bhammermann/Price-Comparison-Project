# Price-Comparison-Project

This Project is being developed by students of the FOM University in Berlin Germany.

The idea behind the project is to create a website that displays the current best prices of products specifically interesting to us, the creaters of this project.
This is meant to be achieved by scraping HTML-Code from the Geizhals website which provides us with the data necessary to create a website that displays the best prices of chosen products.
**This project does not plan to commercialize under any circumstances and is solely created for the purpose of education and practical experience.**

Additionally a paper will be written, describing the planning, execution and reflection of this project.
