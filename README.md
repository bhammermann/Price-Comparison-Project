# Price-Comparison-Project

This Project is being developed by students of the FOM University in Berlin Germany.

The idea behind the project is to create a website that compares prices of products specifically interesting to us, the creaters of this project.
This is meant to be achieved by using an open API(s) that provides us with the data necessary to create a website that compares prices of chosen products.

Additionally a paper will be written, describing the planning, execution and reflection of this project.
